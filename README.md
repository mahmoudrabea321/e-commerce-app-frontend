# E-Commerce Frontend

This is the **frontend** of my full-stack E-Commerce(Zelia) application, built with **React**.
It connects to the backend APIs and provides a smooth shopping experience for users and an admin panel for managing the store.

## Features

* 🔑 **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, and manage user profiles.
* 🛒 **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: Add products to cart and place orders.
* 💳 **PayPal Payment Integration**: Secure checkout with PayPal sandbox.
* 🛠️ **Admin Dashboard**: Manage products, users, and orders.
